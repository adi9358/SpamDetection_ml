Spam Detection
In this repository ,i have created a model that classifies that the message is spam or ham(not spam) ..
the accuracy of the model is pretty good and in last we have do prediction on the new meesage to 
see whether it a spam message or not and we use vector counter to count bag of words remove punctuations 
from the data and use Multinominanl Naive bayes algorithm.
